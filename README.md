# 2016 Data Incubator Challenge Project

This project is a very simple example of how you can use NLP to understand the context of public meetings. I use a sample city council meetings and some basic NLP tools to analyse the transcript of the meeting to highlight relevant words and identify speakers. 
Plots include a frequency count of relevant words and a frequency distribution of speakers by speaker throughout the course of the meeting.  

NOTE: For speed and ease, in this instance I used plot.ly to host interactive plots. 

*Plot 1:* Frequency count of relevant words mentionned in sample city council meeting

*Plot 2:* Frequency distribution of speakers at sample city council meeting   
https://plot.ly/~kstohr/1427/frequency-distribution-of-speakers-sample-city-council-meeting/

*Source code:*  
This was done in Python 3.0 using Jupyter Notebook (again for ease).
