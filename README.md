# data_incubator_2016
2016 Data Incubator Challenge Project

This project is a very simple example of how you can use NLP to understand the context of public meetings. I use a sample city council meetings and some basic NLP tools to analyse the transcript of the meeting to highlight relevant words and identify speakers. 
Plots include a frequency count of relevant words and a frequency distribution of speakers by speaker throughout the course of the meeting.
