  "body": "# 2016 Data Incubator Challenge Project\r\n\r\nThis project is a very simple example of how you can use NLP to understand the context of public meetings. I use a sample city council meetings and some basic NLP tools to analyse the transcript of the meeting to highlight relevant words and identify speakers. \r\nPlots include a frequency count of relevant words and a frequency distribution of speakers by speaker throughout the course of the meeting.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: For speed and ease, in this instance I used plot.ly to host interactive plots. \r\n\r\n*Plot 1:* Frequency count of relevant words mentionned in sample city council meeting  \r\nhttps://plot.ly/~kstohr/1425/frequency-of-relevant-words-sample-city-council-meeting/\r\n\r\n*Plot 2:* Frequency distribution of speakers at sample city council meeting   \r\nhttps://plot.ly/~kstohr/1427/frequency-distribution-of-speakers-sample-city-council-meeting/\r\n\r\n*Source code:*  \r\nThis was done in Python 3.0 using Jupyter Notebook (again for ease).   \r\n[Public Comment Analysis](https://github.com/kstohr/data_incubator_2016/blob/master/public_comment_analysis.ipynb \"Public Comment Analysis\")  \r\n\r\n*Data Source:*\r\nCity of Tampa, City Council Meeting, October 20, 2016, 9am Session   \r\nLink: https://apps.tampagov.net/cttv_cc_webapp/Agenda.aspx?pkey=1981\r\n",
