I use a sample city council meetings and some basic NLP tools to analyse the transcript of the meeting to highlight relevant words and identify speakers. \r\nPlots include a frequency count of relevant words and a frequency distribution of speakers by speaker throughout the course of the meeting.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: For speed and ease, in this instance I used plot.ly to host interactive plots. \r\n\r\nPlot 1: Frequency count of relevant words mentionned in sample city council meeting  \r\nhttps://plot.ly/~kstohr/1425/frequency-of-relevant-words-sample-city-council-meeting/\r\n\r\nPlot 2: Frequency distribution of speakers at sample city council meeting   \r\nhttps://plot.ly/~kstohr/1427/frequency-distribution-of-speakers-sample-city-council-meeting/\r\n\r\nData Source: \r\nCity of Tampa, City Council Meeting, October 20, 2016, 9am Session   \r\nLink: https://apps.tampagov.net/cttv_cc_webapp/Agenda.aspx?pkey=1981\r\n",
